title: "Agile: another word for good sense?"
category: archive
---
Today a lot of people wants to become agile. Well, not agile in the sense of 
[mentally or physically quick](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/results.asp?searchword=agile&x=0&y=0), but Agile (yes, with capital "A")  as written in the 
[Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/). Why? Because it seems like a better way of doing things. This way involves:

* Empower people
* Deliver business value
* Get the client involved
* Embrace changes

Is the word "agile" 
[good enough](http://jchyip.blogspot.com/2007/05/agility-is-not-point.html) to represent all this? I don't know. And to be honest, I think we really shouldn't care. As long as people get what it stands for, the word "agile" is getting the job done.
