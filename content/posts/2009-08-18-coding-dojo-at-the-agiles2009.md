On October I'll have another great reason to travel: running a coding dojo at the **Latin-American Conference on Agile Development Methodologies** (or simply [Ágiles2009](http://www.agiles2009.org/en/session.php?id=63)). And if having an event like that in back in Brazil wasn't good enough, the conference will be in [Florianópolis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian%C3%B3polis), the city where I studied and used to work before moving to London. How cool is that?

For [this session](http://www.agiles2009.org/en/session.php?id=63), it seems like once more the challenge will be how to prepare a session for more people than we're used to. So [Victor Hugo](http://malditacomedia.blogspot.com/) and I still have to come up with something special for this occasion.

Anyway, If you're lucky enough to be around at the conference, please don't hesitate and come say hi :)
