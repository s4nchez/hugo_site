Yesterday we had our [first dojo in 2009](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-scrum/coding-dojo) and once more people asked me when are the next sessions. So here they are:

* Wednesday, January 28th
* Thursday, February 12th
* Wednesday, February 25th
* Monday, March 9th
* Wednesday, March 25th

The dates may change (they already did), so that's one more reason to [join our group](http://groups.google.com/group/coding-dojo-london) or [subscribe to this blog]() to be informed if that happens.
