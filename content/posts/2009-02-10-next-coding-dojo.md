For the people wanting to practice their programming skills, the next **open coding dojo** will be this Thursday (12th) at the [Skillsmatter](http://skillsmatter.com/) office.

After presenting a [very interesting kata](http://isanchez.net/2009/01/30/one-kata-and-a-lot-of-tricks/) on the last session, [Danilo Sato](http://dtsato.com/blog) will be facilitating this dojo.

Don't forget to [register](http://skillsmatter.com/event/agile-scrum/coding-dojo-228) on their website and join [our mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/coding-dojo-london) if you want to know more about the challenge and the session format for this session.
