Then is time to visit [TDD Problems](http://sites.google.com/site/tddproblems/):

> **The aim of this site** is to contain a growing [collection of software problems](http://sites.google.com/site/tddproblems/all-problems-1) well-suited for the TDD-beginner to learn Test-Driven Development through problem solving.

Today the site contains 20 different "real-life" problems, which is probably enough to keep anyone busy for a long time. And since it was announced in the [testdrivendevelopment](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/testdrivendevelopment) list only a few days ago, it's very likely the list will keep growing.

Enjoy!
