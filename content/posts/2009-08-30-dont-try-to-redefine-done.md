title: "Don't try to redefine 'done'"

Many people tried different ways to define what **"done"** means in a software project (as you can see [here](http://www.scrumalliance.org/articles/105-what-is-definition-of-done-dod), [here](http://chrissterling.gettingagile.com/2007/10/05/building-a-definition-of-done/) and [here](http://www.agile-software-development.com/2007/07/definition-of-done-10-point-checklist.html)).

My experience, however, is making me believe that the problem may be in the word itself.

Saying something is **"done"** always creates different expectations depending on who we're talking to. And having to create a specific definition for a word means it will only be valid for the people who agree on it, and as long as they remember it.

The solution? Well, maybe we should simply be using a different word(s). For instance, my gut feeling is that **"ready"** could probably do a better job. The main reason is that it invites further questions ("ready for what?"), whereas done ceases the communication ("if it's done, let's move on.").
