title: "Pomodoro Technique: are we using it wrong?"
category: archive
---
The [Pomodoro Techinique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) has received a lot of attention lately. The reason is simple: it works. It improves focus, removes anxiety because of time and, most of all, help us getting things done.

But the greatest benefit of the technique in my point of view is that it exposes all the interruptions and bad habits we have when doing our jobs. And that's my reason to believe it should be used as a learning tool instead of a new way of working.

That means using the technique as temporary assistance, not the end solution. Instead of using the tool to avoid the factors that decrease our focus, we use it to make them visible and then find ways to avoid them.

After all, do we really need a timer all the time to do our job efficiently?
