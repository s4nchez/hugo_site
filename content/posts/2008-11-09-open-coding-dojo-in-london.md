Thanks to [Gojko](http://gojko.net) and the guys from [Skillsmatter](http://www.skillsmatter.com) I'll be running a regular [coding dojo](http://codingdojo.org/) in London. The challenges, languages, session formats and any other related topic will be discussed in the new [coding-dojo-london](http://groups.google.com/group/coding-dojo-london) group, so if you're interested in attending any session or learning more about how the dojo works, it's a good idea to [subscribe](http://groups.google.com/group/coding-dojo-london/subscribe).

My idea with this group is also help people interested in running other dojos in the city. So far I know [Danilo](http://www.dtsato.com/blog/2008/08/12/coding-dojo-agile-2008/) from [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com) and the guys from [YouDevise](https://dev.youdevise.com/YDBlog/index.php?title=code_dojo) who are doing that, and I hope to see more next year.

The [first session](http://skillsmatter.com/event/agile-scrum/first-coding-dojo) will be on 1st of December and the idea is to have one session every 2 weeks starting in January. All the sessions are free but be aware that some sessions may have limited number of people.
