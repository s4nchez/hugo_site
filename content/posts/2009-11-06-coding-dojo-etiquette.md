At the [√Ågiles2009 coding dojo](http://www.agiles2009.org/pt/session.php?id=63), instead of trying to explain the whole concept of [coding dojo](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?back=WhatIsCodingDojo), I jumped straight to a quick list of items that attendees should bear in mind during the session:

* If you know how to code, you should code.
* If you're coding, everyone else has to understand what you're doing.
* If you're the next to code, avoid breaking the flow.
* If you're not coding, don't disturb who is.
* If you have an idea, show it with code.
* If you're stuck, ask for help.
* If you liked the challenge, try it again at home.

Interesting how this simple "etiquette" helped to make what I consider one of the best dojos I've participated so far.
