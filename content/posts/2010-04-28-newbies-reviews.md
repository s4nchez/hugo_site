It’s been a long time since I had to help a new team member to get familiar with a codebase I’ve been working on for a while. And although this process tends to slow development, I’m really liking the kind of feedback that can emerge from this fresh look at our existing code.

After months of pairing the team developed a common understand of the system that makes sense for everyone involved, but can be really hard to grasp by an outsider. What is interesting is that this lack of familiarity seems to become very useful when it comes to spotting strange design decisions, inconsistencies, naming issues or even simplification and refactoring opportunities that otherwise would be easily neglected.

Maybe that’s something we should be doing more: getting someone who never got close to the code we want to improve and let him play with with it for a short period of time. The feedback this scenario generates is very interesting.
