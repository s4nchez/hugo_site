title: "The three stone cutters"
category: archive

The following parable has made me think about the different views on the software development work:

>
> A traveler came across three individuals working with stones. When asked about what he was doing, the first one replied, "**I'm a stone cutter. I cut stones because I need the money to support my family**".
>
> The traveler then decided to ask the second worker, who answered, "**I'm a great stone cutter. I can use all my techniques to produce the best shaped stone**".
>
> Surprised by the two distinct responses, the traveler finally asks the third man what he was doing. The worker stopped for a moment and then said, "**I'm a stone cutter and I'm building a cathedral**".

Sometimes I have this feeling that we as professionals are frequently trying to be more like the second stone cutter than the the third one. Am I the only one?
