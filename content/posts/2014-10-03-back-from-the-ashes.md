It's been over two and a half years I don't post anything here. In the meantime I've used [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) mainly as a backup of my old posts.

Today I've found that I was running a version so old of Jekyll that it was breaking this site almost completely, so I've decided to upgrade it and apply the [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme so it looks at least half decent.

All the old posts are still available in the [Archive](archive.html) page.

If you saw this post in your RSS reader:

1. Thank you for staying around (or for just not cleaning up your feed that often)
2. Let me know if anything breaks!
