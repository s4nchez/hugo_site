Writing check-in messages is normally a reflection time for me. And lately I've been inclined to describe **why** I changed the code, instead of just describing what I've changed.

I know I have to consider that all the time, but it can still serve as a last sanity check. It makes me think: "Am I really adding a valuable change to the codebase?"

Do you agree with this approach? Think about it next time you check-in and then let me know in the comments.
