Another day of coding is over and you produced some beautiful code. Now what? Do you know exactly how long it will take until that brand-new feature gets to its intended user? A week? A month? Never?

It's a shame that most code produced out there will park for all that time until is released. Maybe that was normal when it would take days just to compile the whole system. But today, even with all the processing power and automation, new releases are always delayed by deadlines, testing stages, approvals, sign-offs or any other form of bureaucracy.

If the code is really good it shouldn't have to wait. Maybe it's time for programmers to stop hiding behind the green bars of their builds and start pushing their code out of the door.
