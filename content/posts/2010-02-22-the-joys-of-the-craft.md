The [Mythical Man-Month](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month) is a great book not only because of its insights about software projects. [Fred Brooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks) also writes about the "**The Joys of the Craft**":

>
> Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expects as his reward?
>
> * The first is the sheer joy of making things.
> * [...] Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people.
> * [...] Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning.
> * [...] Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the non repeating nature of the task.
> * [...] Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium.

> The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff.

Really worth the reading.
