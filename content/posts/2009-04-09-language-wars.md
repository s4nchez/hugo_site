Is it just me who's loving this whole [Ruby vs. Scala](http://topsecretproject.finitestatemachine.com/2009/04/the-great-twitter-ruby-vs-scala-war-debate/) debate going on lately? So far it shows that:

* No language can prevent bad code.
* There will be never an ultimate language, but there will always be people to defend the one they are using.
* Java (the language, not the platform) is dead.

I know it's not the first time we have a language war and I have to confess I was missing that a little. Years ago it was Visual Basic vs. Delphi, then C++ vs Java, now it's [Ruby vs. Scala](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=ruby+scala).

And I have to confess: I'm already curious to see what will be the next one.
