Next Thursday I'll be running a coding dojo at the [Software Craftsmanship 2009](http://parlezuml.com/softwarecraftsmanship/). My goal is to discuss [why people should organise dojos at their companies](http://www.isanchez.net/archive/5-reasons-to-have-a-coding-dojo-at-your-company.html) and learn more about alternative approaches people are using to improve programming skills.

It seems like it'll be an interesting event:

>This conference is all about the principles and practices, and the disciplines and habits, that distinguish the best 10% of software  			professionals from the 90% who are failing their customers and  			failing their profession by taking no care or pride in their work and delivering buggy, unreliable and unmaintainable code.

If you managed to save your spot (registration are now closed), see you there!
