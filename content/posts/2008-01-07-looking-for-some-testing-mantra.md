Then it's time to try the [Way of Testivus](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=203994):

* If you write code, write tests.
* Donâ€™t get stuck on unit testing dogma.
* Embrace unit testing karma.
* Think of code and test as one.
* The test is more important than the unit.
* The best time to test is when the code is fresh.
* Tests not run waste away.
* An imperfect test today is better than a perfect test someday.
* An ugly test is better than no test.
* Sometimes, the test justifies the means.
* Only fools use no tools.
* Good tests fail.
