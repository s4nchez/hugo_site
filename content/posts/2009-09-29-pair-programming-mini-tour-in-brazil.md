title: "Pair Programming (mini) Tour in Brazil"
category: archive
---
Tomorrow I'm flying to Brazil and will have a chance to do do something I wanted for a long time: a pair programming tour. The goal is simple: work with people in their companies. Not speaking, consulting or running coding dojos. I want to experience the everyday routine, learning their ways and hopefully contributing with some of my skills too.

This idea came from [Corey Haines](http://www.coreyhaines.com/)'s [programming tours](http://programmingtour.blogspot.com/) and the work of other craftsmen like [Enrique Riepenhausen](http://blog.nexwerk.com/), [Dave Hoover](http://nuts.redsquirrel.com/) and [Antony Marcano](http://www.testingreflections.com/blog/2) from [PairWith.us](http://www.pairwith.us/).

Hopefully it will be an interesting way to learn new tricks.

Unfortunately I'll have only three days to accomplish my goal. The good news is that it took less than a day to be contacted by more companies that I'll be able to visit, which shows I'm not the only one thinking this can be a very good experience.
