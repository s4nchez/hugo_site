This Wednesday (April 22nd) we'll have another coding dojo at Skillsmatter. This time the challenge will be the [Poker Hands](http://acm.uva.es/p/v103/10315.html):

> [...] Your job is to compare several pairs of poker hands and to indicate which, if either, has a higher rank.

[Here](http://github.com/codingdojolondon/sessions/tree/ac6bcb7e3f2f198b61d9b8e2af84e31e99a98fd0/poker_hands)'s some initial code generated at a previous dojo that may serve as starting point for the solution. The session format will be a [Randori](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?RandoriKata), which means everyone is welcome to code.

As usual, registration is required and should be done at [Skillsmatter's website](http://skillsmatter.com/event/agile-scrum/coding-dojo-233). If you have any questions or suggestions for this session please feel free to participate in the [Coding Dojo London mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/coding-dojo-london).
