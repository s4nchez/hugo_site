We had some years to digest the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/). Now it seems like the next step is being defined in the [Software Craftsmanship Manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/main):

>
> As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft.  Through this work we have come to value:
>
> * Not only working software, but also **well-crafted software**
> * Not only responding to change, but also **steadily adding value**
> * Not only individuals and interactions, but also a **community of professionals**
> * Not only customer collaboration, but also **productive partnerships**
>
> That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.

We've been learning to produce better software for a long time so it seems natural to start asking ourselves to be more **responsible** about what and how we deliver it.
